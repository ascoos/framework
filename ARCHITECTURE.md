# Architecture - Ascoos OS

Ascoos OS is a Web 5.0 Kernel for decentralized web and IoT applications, featuring ~4500 encrypted classes.

## Core Components
- **Kernel**: Core classes (e.g., `TObject`, `TArrayHandler`) for foundational functionality.
- **Extras**: Optional classes (e.g., `TArrayAnalysisHandler`) for specialized tasks.
- **JSQL**: JSON-based database system.
- **WIC**: Secure image transfer format.
- **AI & NLP**: Advanced language processing and neural networks.
- **jAscoos**: JavaScript frameworks.
- **LibIn**: Third-party library management.
- **BootLib**: Modular UI framework with Flex support for responsive designs.

## Design Principles
- **Modularity**: Classes organized in `/kernel/` and `/extras/`.
- **Scalability**: Supports web, IoT, and decentralized applications.
- **Security**: IonCube encryption, Ascoos Security System (ASS), and unique license keys (AGL).

## Security
- **Ascoos Security System (ASS)**: Multi-layered protection framework.
- **IonCube**: Core encryption.
- **Unique License Keys**: Licensed under AGL.
